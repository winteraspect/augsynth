multisynth_qp(
  X,
  trt,
  mask,
  n_leads = NULL,
  n_lags = NULL,
  relative = T,
  nu = 0,
  lambda = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix of pre-final intervention outcomes, or list of such matrices after transformations}

\item{trt}{Vector of treatment levels/times}

\item{mask}{Matrix with indicators for observed pre-intervention times for each treatment group}

\item{n_leads}{Number of time periods after treatment to impute control values.
For units treated at time T_j, all units treated after T_j + n_leads
will be used as control values. If larger than the number of periods,
only never never treated units (pure controls) will be used as comparison units}

\item{n_lags}{Number of pre-treatment periods to balance, default is to balance all periods}

\item{relative}{Whether to re-index time according to treatment date, default T}

\item{nu}{Hyper-parameter that controls trade-off between overall and individual balance.
Larger values of nu place more emphasis on individual balance.
Balance measure is
  nu ||global|| + (1-nu) ||individual||
Default: 0}

\item{lambda}{Regularization hyper-parameter. Default, 0}

\item{time_cohort}{Whether to average synthetic controls into time cohorts}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print logs for osqp}

\item{eps_rel}{Relative error tolerance for osqp}

\item{eps_abs}{Absolute error tolerance for osqp}
}
\value{
\itemize{
         \item{"weights"}{Matrix of unit weights}
         \item{"imbalance"}{Matrix of overall and group specific imbalance}
         \item{"global_l2"}{Imbalance overall}
         \item{"ind_l2"}{Matrix of imbalance for each group}
