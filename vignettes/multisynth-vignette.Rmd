# `augsynth`: Estimating treatment effects with staggered adoption

### The data

To show the features of the `multisynth` function we will use data on the effects of states implementing mandatory collective bargaining agreements for public sector unions [(Paglayan, 2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12388)

```{r results="hide", warning=F, message=F}
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(augsynth)
```

```{r }
data <- read.csv("https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/:persistentId?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/WGWMAV/3UHTLP", sep="\t")
```

The dataset contains several important variables that we'll use:

- `year`, `State`: The state and year of the measurement
- `YearCBrequired`: The year that the state adopted mandatory collective bargaining
- `lnppexpend`: Log per pupil expenditures in constant 2010 $

```{r echo = F}
data %>% 
    filter(year == 1960) %>% 
    select(year, State, YearCBrequired, lnppexpend) %>%
    head() %>%
    kable() %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options =c("hover", "responsive"))
```

To run `multisynth`, we need to include a treatment status column that indicates which state is treated in a given year, we call this `cbr` below. We also restrict to the years 1959-1997 where we have yearly measurements of expenditures and drop Washington D.C. and Wisconsin from the analysis.

```{r }
data %>%
    filter(!State %in% c("DC", "WI"),
           year >= 1959, year <= 1997) %>%
    mutate(YearCBrequired = ifelse(is.na(YearCBrequired), 
                                   Inf, YearCBrequired),
           cbr = 1 * (year >= YearCBrequired)) -> analysis_df
```

## Partially pooled SCM

To fit partially pooled synthetic controls, we need to give `multisynth` a formula of the form `outcome ~ treatment`, point it to the unit and time variables, and choose the level of partial pooling `nu`. Setting `nu = 0` fits a separate synthetic control for each treated unit and setting `nu = 1` fits fully pooled synthetic controls. If we don't set `nu`, `multisynth` will choose a heuristic value based on how well separate synthetic controls balance the overall average. We can also set the number of post-treatment time periods (leads) that we want to estimate with the `n_leads` argument (by default `multisynth` uses the number of post-treatment periods for the last treated unit).

```{r }
# with a choice of nu
ppool_syn <- multisynth(lnppexpend ~ cbr, State, year, 
                        nu = 0.5, analysis_df, n_leads = 10)
# with default nu
ppool_syn <- multisynth(lnppexpend ~ cbr, State, year, 
                        analysis_df, n_leads = 10)

print(ppool_syn$nu)

ppool_syn
```

Using the `summary` function, we'll compute the treatment effects and jackknife standard errors for all treated units as well as the average. (This takes a bit of time so we'll store the output)

```{r}
ppool_syn_summ <- summary(ppool_syn)
```

We can then report the level of global and individual balance as well as estimates for the average.

```{r }
ppool_syn_summ
```

`nopool_syn_summ$att` is a dataframe that contains all of the point estimates and standard errors. `Time = NA` denotes the effect averaged across the post treatment periods.

```{r echo = F}
ppool_syn_summ$att %>%
  filter(Time >= 0) %>%
  head() %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options =c("hover", "responsive"))
```

We can also visually display both the pre-treatment balance and the estimated treatment effects.

```{r ppool_syn_plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, fig.align="center", warning=F, message=F}
plot(ppool_syn_summ)
```

And again we can hone in on the average effects.

```{r ppool_syn_plot_avg, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, fig.align="center", warning=F, message=F}
plot(ppool_syn_summ, level = "Average")
```


We can also collapse treated units with the same treatment time into _time cohorts_, and find one synthetic control per time cohort by setting `time_cohort = TRUE`. When the number of distinct treatment times is much smaller than the number of treated units, this will run significantly faster.

```{r }
# with default nu
ppool_syn_time <- multisynth(lnppexpend ~ cbr, State, year,
                        analysis_df, n_leads = 10, time_cohort = TRUE)

print(ppool_syn_time$nu)

ppool_syn_time
```

We can then compute effects for the overall average as well as for each treatment time cohort, rather than individual units.

```{r}
ppool_syn_time_summ <- summary(ppool_syn_time)
ppool_syn_time_summ
```

```{r echo = F}
ppool_syn_time_summ$att %>%
  filter(Time >= 0) %>%
  head() %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options =c("hover", "responsive"))
```

Again we can plot the effects.

```{r ppool_syn_time_plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, fig.align="center", warning=F, message=F}
plot(ppool_syn_time_summ)
```


## Combining with outcome modeling

### Weighted event studies
There is particularly bad pre-treatment fit for a few states, so we can augment the synthetic controls estimates with outcome modeling to adjust for the poor fit. A simple form of augmentation combines the synth estimates with a unit fixed effects model, removing the pre-treatment averages for each state and fitting partially pooled SCM after de-meaning. To do this with `multisynth` we set `fixedeff = T`.

```{r }
wevent <- multisynth(lnppexpend ~ cbr, State, year, 
                        analysis_df, n_leads = 10, fixedeff = T)

print(wevent$nu)

wevent
```

We can again get jackknife standard error estimates to go along with our point estimates, and inspect the results. We see that we get much better pre-treatment fit by explciitly accounting for pre-treatment averages.

```{r}
wevent_summ <- summary(wevent)
```

```{r }
wevent_summ
```


```{r wevent_plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, fig.align="center", warning=F, message=F}
plot(wevent_summ)
```

```{r wevent_plot_avg, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, fig.align="center", warning=F, message=F}
plot(wevent_summ, level = "Average")
```



### Augmenting with other outcome models

We can also augment the partially pooled SCM estimates by directly fitting a factor model with [`gsynth`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gsynth/gsynth.pdf). To do this, we can set the `n_factors` argument to be the number of factors we want to estimate. By default, `n_factors = 0`, which combined with `fixedeff = T` gives the weighted event study above. (`n_factors = NULL` chooses the number of factors via cross validation)

```{r }
scm_gsyn <- multisynth(lnppexpend ~ cbr, State, year,
                        analysis_df, n_leads = 10, 
                        fixedeff = T, n_factors = NULL)

# number of factors
print(ncol(scm_gsyn$params$factor))

scm_gsyn
```

```{r }
scm_gsyn_summ <- summary(scm_gsyn)

scm_gsyn_summ
```

```{r scm_gsyn_plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, fig.align="center", warning=F, message=F}
plot(scm_gsyn_summ, level="Average")
```
